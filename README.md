# maajiik
Maajiik is a dungeon crawler game in which you escape the greta prison of Zagabaga! To play you move around using WASD, 
use your weapon by pressing p, cast your spell using o, and use the 3 keys on the doors to unlock them (red=1, blue=2, black=3).
The doors will flash red if you get enter the wrong code. Talk to the NPC's by walking towards them to uncover clues.
